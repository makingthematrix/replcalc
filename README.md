# REPLcalc
This is going to be a small REPL calculator in Scala 3.1.

It's based on the calculator from my [Scala on Android](https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid) project,
but I want to iron out a few things (that unary minus operator...), and add logic for parentheses, values, and functions.
